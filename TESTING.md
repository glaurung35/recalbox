# Testing

This file is in french as all our beta testers are french.


A chaque modification du système, les développeurs ajoutent une ou plusieurs lignes dans ce fichier.

Les beta testeurs cochent les cases lors des sessions de tests.

Toutes les cases doivent être cochées avant la release stable.

Pour les pending features, elles ne seront activées que si les beta testeurs les valident selon les critères de qualité de Recalbox.

## Technique
- [X] Packages that require libgo2 compiles well
- [X] /usr/lib/libgo2.so should provides go2_ symbols
- [X] Validate libretro-mupen64plus-next compiles on all boards
- [X] BR2020.11 - Test kodi-audiodecoder-timidity (how ?)
- [X] BR2020.11 - Check that kernel patchs are applied on linux and (cutom) linux-headers

- [X] Test S024kdetector still does its job

- [X] Check that there are no regression with kernel 5.10 on rpi boards
- [X] Tester que le GPi ou NesPi4 case s'installent correctement (via installation fraiche)


## [7.1-Reloaded]
- [X] Bumped picodrive to fix rewind on megadrive => test the rewind on megadrive/picodrive
- [X] Clock should update properly
- [X] Battery icon should show and update properly on PC when battery data are available, especially for a pc with /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1
- [X] Test audio output persistancy in ES => change output, reboot ES, check if still selected, once again
- [X] Check that a P2K file is visible in UI => create a .p2k.cfg file in a rom directory, then check that p2k hints are available for all games in this folder
- [X] Check network menu translations especially for WIFI (ON/OFF/WPS)
- [X] Check regional system logo => switch theme, reboot, check that regionalized logo are shown properly (GB, SNES, ...)

- [X] Kodi executable check => Check if all kodi menu are NOT visible on GO2
- [X] Virtual Keyboard => check if dpad + J1 move the wheel and j2 moves the cursor
- [X] Fixed VIC20 extensions => Run games for VIC20 with any extension but .20 .40 .60 .a0 .b0.
- [X] Fixed scrapper settings not being saved => Set global scrapper settings without running a global scrapping. Instead, run a single game scrapping and check results accordingly
- [X] Fixed gamelist.xml being overwritten when edited from outside ES => Run ES, play a game, edit a gamelist from the network share, wait for ES to detect the change, let Es relaunch, then check if your modification is still there

- [X] Pi400 support => Boot on Pi400 using Pi4 image
- [X] Check that kodi does not crash upon loading
- [X] Test all broke studio games!

WHDL with PUAE must be deeply tested. Some bioses still don't load.
