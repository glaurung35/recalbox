## RECALBOX - SYSTEM COMMODORE 64 ##

Put your Commodore 64 roms in this directory.

Rom files must have a ".d64/.d71/.d80/.d81/.d82/.g41/.g64/.t64/.x64/.tap/.prg/.p00/.crt/.zip/.7z" extension.

This system allows to use compressed roms on .zip/.7z.
But, it is only an archive. Files inside the .zip/.7z must match with extensions mentioned above.
Each .zip/.7z file must contain only one compressed rom.
