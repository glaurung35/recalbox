    <name>Inspector Waffles Early Days (demo)</name>
    <desc>Inspector Waffles Early Days is the prequel of Inspector Waffles, the adventure/detective game released in 2021.
This time, you follow a younger Waffles, a cunning and witty cat, in his first days as an Inspector who wants to prove to everyone that he is more than just a rookie.
Your partner, Pancakes, is an experienced Inspector and probably the only one at the police station that isn't an incompetent policecat.
With this top-tier team, catching bad guys could sound easy, but beware… Your future worst enemy is hiding in the shadows, waiting for you to make the first mistake.</desc>
