March 28, 2013
-Hopefully fixed bad joystick events at startup.

March 25, 2013
-Fixed waking up from sleep with axes.

December 20, 2012

December 14, 2012
-Added %BASENAME% tag for launch commands. Useful for AdvMAME.

December 8, 2012
-Fixed a segfault when opening the menu (related to sounds). Woops!

November 19
-Added Arch Linux's DejaVuSeriff.ttf path to the list of fonts to check for.

November 17
-Fixed default game image resizing if none is defined.

-Fixed GuiBox background being positioned wrong.
-Fixed GuiBox/GuiFastSelect render order.
-Redid tiling to use only 6 verticies (instead of tilecount-dependent) with wrapped textures. Tiling is also precise now (cuts off when it should).

October 7
-Fixed borders for GuiBox. The right and bottom borders are flipped, too.
-Added corners for GuiBox.
-Added setFlipX() and setFlipY() to the GuiImage class.

September 30
-Began implementing GuiFastSelect, currently invoked by holding F2. Unfortunately, it doesn't do anything yet.

September 29
-SDL is now completely shut down on both the RPi and SDL GL renderer. You may see the flicker of a terminal when you launch a game. This was done in preparation for audio.

September 23
-Fixed crash when "%ROM%" isn't present in a launch command. Not sure why you'd ever do this on purpose, but hey.
-Added relative path operator ("./") support for gamelist.xml, for both game paths and image paths.

September 16
-Fixed a bug with skipping over unicode characters. [X] will be displayed if the character is not standard ASCII (characters 32 to 127).

September 15
-Added <listOffsetX>, <listTextOffsetX>, and <gameImageOffsetY> theme tags. See THEMES.md for details.
-Fixed a bug causing gamelists to be read incorrectly.

September 14
-Joystick names are now saved during input configuration to es_input.cfg.

-Joysticks should re-initialize properly with SDL on the desktop configuration.

September 10
-Fixed multiple extensions breaking things.
-Added Makefile.x86 for building on a desktop (acquire OpenGL context through SDL instead of EGL).

September 8

September 7
-Tiling is now much faster.
-Added --draw-framerate and --help/-h command-line parameters.

-Added <listLeftAlign /> tag that makes the game list left aligned instead of centered.
-Made Renderer::LARGE (header) fontsize slightly bigger

August 12
-If a theme.xml is not found in a system's directory, ES will now check for $HOME/.emulationstation/es_theme.xml. If present, it will load that.
-Themes can now be used without the detailed GuiGameList.
-Fixed GuiGameList image data not updating on system change/initial startup (finally!)
-Made the GuiList code a little bit less likely to crash on empty lists

August 8
-Added automatic resizing of images using SDL_gfx

-Removed warning if an unknown variable is found in a systems config file (useful for additional utilities)

August 7
