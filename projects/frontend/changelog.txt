September 23
-Fixed crash when "%ROM%" isn't present in a launch command. Not sure why you'd ever do this on purpose, but hey.
-Added relative path operator ("./") support for gamelist.xml, for both game paths and image paths.

September 16
-Fixed a bug with skipping over unicode characters. [X] will be displayed if the character is not standard ASCII (characters 32 to 127).

September 15
-Added <listOffsetX>, <listTextOffsetX>, and <gameImageOffsetY> theme tags. See THEMES.md for details.
-Fixed a bug causing gamelists to be read incorrectly.

September 14
-Joystick names are now saved during input configuration to es_input.cfg.
-When loading an input config, if JOYNAME is defined, load the first joystick with that name. If it is not present, load the first joystick (old behavior).
-Joysticks should re-initialize properly with SDL on the desktop configuration.

September 10

-Updated example systems config to include example for multiple filetypes and be a little clearer.

September 7
-Tiling is now much faster.
-Added --draw-framerate and --help/-h command-line parameters.
-Fixed themes not properly re-initializing.
-Commented most headers. Things should be kind of understandable now.
-Finally increased scrolling speed.

September 3
-Everything is now rendered with OpenGL, leading to a (roughly) 600%+ speedup!

August 13
-Tons of new theming features!
-I've added a THEMES.md file for documentation on theming.
-A CREDITS.md file.

-Fixed theme defaults not resetting when theme changes.
-The game image on the GuiGameList now maintains its alpha channel.
-Descriptions can now contain newline characters.
-Changed the size of the game info column to be 50% of the screen (previously 40%).

-Added $infoWidth variable for playing with the size of the game info column.
-Added <listLeftAlign /> tag that makes the game list left aligned instead of centered.
-Made Renderer::LARGE (header) fontsize slightly bigger

August 12
-If a theme.xml is not found in a system's directory, ES will now check for $HOME/.emulationstation/es_theme.xml. If present, it will load that.
-Themes can now be used without the detailed GuiGameList.
-Fixed GuiGameList image data not updating on system change/initial startup (finally!)
-Made the GuiList code a little bit less likely to crash on empty lists

August 10
-Themes now load from system directories (and thus you can set a different theme for each system)
-Theme paths now expand . (to directory of this theme.xml) and ~ (to $HOME).
-Added --ignore-gamelist switch. Does as it says, and forces the simple GuiGameList.
-Folders that do not contain games will not be added.
-Fixed float percentages in GuiTheme being converted to integers before they were converted to pixels...woops!

August 9
-Removed multithreaded image loading
-Improved GuiImage rendering speed by adding additional processing at load time (SDL_DisplayFormat)
-Began work on the GuiTheme class, allowing custom theming with an XML file

August 8
-Added automatic resizing of images using SDL_gfx
-Experimenting with multithreaded image loading for the GuiImage class
-Removed warning if an unknown variable is found in a systems config file (useful for additional utilities)

August 7
-gamelist.xml files are now read from each system's individual search directory.
-The switch --gamelist-only was added. Use it to skip automatic searching and only use files defined in gamelist.xml.
-A gamelist.xml file can now specify a file that wasn't previously found by the automatic search.
-Fixed alphabetizing uppercase and lowercase letters differently (woops!)
-When loading the system config file, if a system doesn't contain any games, it will be automatically deleted.

August 4
